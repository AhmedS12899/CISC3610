<h2>Philadelphia Sixers vs Toronto Raptors</h2>
<p>No team in NBA history has lost a playoff series after taking a 3-0 lead, but that is the scenario the Philadelphia 76ers face if they can't close out their first round series against the Toronto Raptors in Game 6 on Thursday night. The path to victory won't be easy, as superstar center Joel Embiid is playing with a torn thumb ligament, defensive stopper Matisse Thybulle is ineligible to play in Toronto due to his COVID vaccination status, and James Harden has shot a miserable 37.3 percent from the field in the series thus far. Meanwhile, Toronto's Pascal Siakam scored 57 total points in Games 4 and 5 and hit 55.6 percent of his shots to lead the Raptors in those starts.</p>
